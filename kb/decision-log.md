# Decision log

Decisions already made. Do not re-litigate; add a dated entry to change one.

## 2026-10-04

- **Name** `saturnus`, Latin for the god and the planet. Rejected: anything
  with "hp" in it (trademark exposure for a project that runs HP ROMs),
  `saturnite`, `kayamanu`, `encke`, `aerarium`.
- **License** MIT with `AI_NOTICE`; public repo; GitHub user `ractive`.
- **Language and layout** Rust, edition 2024. Crates `saturnus` (core: CPU,
  bus, modules, peripherals, machine configs; no I/O, no UI, WASM-able),
  `saturnus-cli` (headless runner), later `saturnus-mcp` and UIs.
- **Clean room** from documentation and ROM behaviour only; see
  [[docs/clean-room-rule]].
- **Target order** HP48SX (Clarke chip, no bank switching, 32 KB RAM), then
  HP48GX, HP49G, then HP38G/39G/40G.
- **Accuracy target** what the ROM needs, not cycle-exactness: TIMER2 running,
  the RAM magic word, module configuration on the 48S, battery and card
  switches on every interrupt; the ROM halts with "Clock corrupted" if TIMER2
  stops.
- **No emulator frameworks**: none exist for the Saturn; libretro is a
  front-end API for game consoles.
