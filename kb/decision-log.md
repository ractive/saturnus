# Decision log

Decisions already made. Do not re-litigate; add a dated entry to change one.

## 2026-10-04

- **Name** `saturnus`, Latin for the god and the planet. Rejected: anything
  with "hp" in it (trademark exposure for a project that runs HP ROMs),
  `saturnite`, `kayamanu`, `encke`, `aerarium`.
- **License** MIT with `AI_NOTICE`; public repo; GitHub user `ractive`.
- **Language and layout** Rust, edition 2024. Crates `saturnus` (core: CPU,
  bus, modules, peripherals, machine configs; no I/O, no UI, WASM-able),
  `saturnus-cli` (headless runner), later `saturnus-mcp` and UIs.
- **Clean room** from documentation and ROM behaviour only; see
  [[docs/clean-room-rule]].
- **Target order** HP48SX (Clarke chip, no bank switching, 32 KB RAM), then
  HP48GX, HP49G, then HP38G/39G/40G.
- **Accuracy target** what the ROM needs, not cycle-exactness: TIMER2 running,
  the RAM magic word, module configuration on the 48S, battery and card
  switches on every interrupt; the ROM halts with "Clock corrupted" if TIMER2
  stops.
- **No emulator frameworks**: none exist for the Saturn; libretro is a
  front-end API for game consoles.

## 2026-10-04 (iteration 1)

- **Source precedence for CPU semantics**: HP's SASM manual
  (`raw/saturn-hardware/hp48-sdk-1993/SASM.TXT`) over the Fernandes/Rechlin
  tutorial over Gariepy and Mastracci. Where they disagree the code comment
  says so. Findings go back to the wiki page `hardware/saturn-cpu`.
- **Add/subtract constant**: always hexadecimal (SASM 2.7); single-nibble
  fields overrun circularly through all 16 nibbles, which reproduces the
  tutorial's examples. Pinned by a test; marked
  `TODO(questions/dec-mode-constant-bug)`.
- **A=IN / C=IN parity**: the even-address restriction is ignored; the
  failure mode on odd addresses is undocumented and the ROM always calls
  through CINRTN.
- **Undefined encodings** decode to `Instruction::Invalid`; the executor
  advances PC by the decoded length and reports an event instead of
  guessing hardware aliasing.
- **Opcode oracle**: the round-trip test against HP's `SASM.OPC` runs only
  when `SATURNUS_LITERATURE_DIR` points at the literature library. The file
  stays out of the repo (HP copyright).
- **Test code may use `unwrap`/`expect`**: `lib.rs` allows the clippy lints
  under `cfg(test)`; production code stays free of them.
